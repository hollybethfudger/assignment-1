                <p>I walked through the door with you<br>
                The air was cold<br>
                But something about it felt like home somehow<br>
                And I, left my <mark>scarf</mark> there at your sister's house<br>
                And you've still got it in your drawer <em>even now</em></p>
                
                <p>Oh, your sweet disposition<br>
                And my wide-eyed gaze<br>
                We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate<br>
                Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place<br>
                And I can picture it after all these days</p>

                <p>'Cause there we are again on that little town street<br>
                You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me<br>
                Wind in my hair, I was there<br>
                I remember it all too well</p>

                Your cheeks were turning red<br>
                You used to be a <mark>little kid with glasses</mark> in a twin-sized bed<br>
                
                And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team<br>
                You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me</p>

                <p>And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do<br>
                And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to</p>

                <p>'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night<br>
                We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light<br>
                Down the stairs, I was there<br>
                I remember it all too well, yeah</p>

                <h3>Bridge</h3>
                <p><strong>And maybe we got lost in translation</strong><br>
                Maybe I asked for too much<br>
                But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up<br>
                Running scared, I was there<br>
                I remember it all too well</p>
                <!-- My favorite part of the song -->
                <p><strong>And you call me up again just to break me like a promise</strong><br>
                So <em>casually cruel</em> in the name of being honest<br>
                <em>I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here</em><br>
                'Cause I remember it all, <em>all</em>, <em><strong>ALL</strong></em><br>
                Too well</p>

                <p>Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it<br>
                I'd like to be my old self again<br>
                But I'm still trying to find it<br>
                After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own<br>
                Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone<br>
                But <mark>you keep my old scarf</mark> from that <em>very first week</em><br>
                'Cause it reminds you of innocence<br>
                And it smells like me<br>
                You can't get rid of it<br>
                'Cause you remember it <em>all too well,</em> yeah</p>
